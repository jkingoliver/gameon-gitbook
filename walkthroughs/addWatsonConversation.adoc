Where we learn about how to integrate Watson Conversation service with a Swift chat room.

## Overview

This adventure will teach you about integrating a Watson Conversation service into your Swift room by walking you through the process of creating your own Watson service in Bluemix and adding integration points to a GameOn room.
You will come away having learned a little about using Watson services and there will be suggestions for how you can use this further
within a room.

## Why Watson?

More and more developers are demanding the use of cognitive features in their applications. That’s why IBM Watson is targeting the need by providing many services through Bluemix that can be easily integrated into applications through a REST API. There are many services available on Watson, and they can be divided into major categories such as “language”, “speech”, “vision”, and “data insights”. Some very popular services include Natural Language Understanding for recognizing the meaning behind natural language and Visual Recognition for classifying contents in images. This adventure focuses on Natural Language Understanding using Watson’s Conversation service.

Because interfacing with a REST endpoint using low-level networking calls quickly becomes inefficient, there are many Watson Developer Cloud SDK’s that have been created to simplify making requests, exposing natural functions and data structures for the language. What would have taken over 500 lines of code, takes now 10. The Watson Swift SDK, previously named the iOS SDK, is now the second most used Watson SDK (after the NodeJS SDK). It had its origins, obviously, for the iOS mobile use case, but since the Swift programming language now can be used for running Linux, it has opened the SDK for usage for server-side programming as well. Now you can use the same SDK you have bundled in your client application, and easily move that functionality out to the server, giving you more control over the frequency at which calls to Watson are made, have a single point for credentials for making the calls, and also can create applications where the result of the request to Watson can be shared with multiple users.

In this adventure, we take an existing GameOn Swift room and integrate with a Watson Conversation service, so that the Watson bot can respond to chat messages from GameOn participants.

## Prerequisites

First, you’ll need to create and configure a new Watson Conversation service. Building out a new Conversation service should only take a few minutes once you have a Bluemix account (you can get a free test account too).

. Create a new Watson Conversation service in link:https://console.ng.bluemix.net[Bluemix].
+ 
You will need to sign up for a Bluemix account if you don’t have one already.
+
Navigate to “Catalog” and search for “Conversation”, select it from the results and create a free plan.

. Get the credentials from your service. 
+
After your conversation service has been created, you will be able to get the username and password for the service from the “Service credentials” tab -> “View credentials” dropdown. Record these now, you will need it later when we start coding your application.

[start=3]
. Create a new Workspace for your application. 
+
A workspace is the way you can express a dialog. Your Watson Conversation service may contain many workspaces for all of your user flows.
+
Under the manage tab, select “Launch tool”. Create a workspace and name it “Sandwich shop.”

image::watson-workspaces.png[]

[start=4]
. Create intents. 
+
Intents are the ways Watson understands the user’s intent. In other words, you can train the Watson Natural Language classifier with a bunch of examples of ways of expressing an intent like “ordering a sandwich”, and in the future, even though your users won’t necessarily write their requests exactly how you specified it, through training the language model Watson will select the intent if that request matched it within a certain threshold level.
+
So for our example, you can add a new intent called “#order” and the values can be:

[start=5]
. Create entities. 
+
Entities are the specifics of information that can come in through the intents. Entities are most likely nouns that help you better service the request. For our example, we will be creating some entity types like, @toppings and @meats.
+
Try adding some @toppings now:

[start=6]
. Design the dialog. 
+
You can now design your dialog with the intents and entities you created earlier. Your must create triggers that based on whether it is matched or not, will yield a response from Watson.

image::watson-dialog2.png[]

[start=7]
. Test your conversation. 
+
It’s probably a good idea at this point to test your conversation and make sure it’s working properly. You can press the dialog bubble icon on the top right to start a simulation of your conversation.

[start=8]
. Get the workspace ID. 
+
Before we start making modifications to your GameOn room, copy your workspace ID. Follow the menu option to workspace, select the “drawer” icon next to the workspace card and choose “view details” in order to see your workspace ID. You will need this ID later when you connect your code to this workspace.

## Walkthrough

. Fork and clone the sample-swift-room

[source, swift]
----
git clone https://github.com/<your-forked-repo>/sample-room-swift.git
----

[start=2]
. Add the Watson SDK as a dependency in your project
+
In your Package.swift file, add to the bottom of the list of dependencies the following library:

[source,swift]
----
.Package(url: "https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk", majorVersion: 0)
----

[start=3]
. In Source/SwiftRoom/RoomImplementation.swift, import the Conversation service modules:

[source,swift]
----
import ConversationV1
----

[start=4]
. Set some of the settings for your service:
[source,swift]
----
let username = "username-goes-here"
let password = "password-goes-here"
let version = "2017-03-22”
let workspaceID = "workspace-id-goes-here"
----

[start=5]
.Add a Conversation service object to your RoomImplementation class:
[source,swift]
----
let conversation = Conversation(username: username, 
                                password: password,
                                version: version)
----

[start=6]
. Add a Context for the conversation
+
A context allows the conversation to hold state. For instance, when you are finished selecting the meat on your sandwich, Watson continues the conversation with asking about toppings. Since REST calls are stateless by nature, we can hold state by keeping a state ID that is updated whenever you get a new response back.
[source,swift]
----
var context: Context?
----

[start=7]
. Set the context of the conversation on application start.
[source,swift]
----
public init() {
 
       conversation.message(withWorkspace: workspaceID,
                            failure: failure) { 
              response in

              self.context = response.context
       }
 
}
----

[start=8]
. RoomImplementation.swift will now look like this:
+
[source,swift]
----
import LoggerAPI
import Foundation
import KituraWebSocket
import SwiftyJSON

import ConversationV1

let username = "username-goes-here"
let password = "password-goes-here"
let version = "2017-03-22”
let workspaceID = "workspace-id-goes-here"
let conversation = Conversation(username: username, password: password, version: version)

let failure = { (error: Error) in print(error) }

public class RoomImplementation {
        
    var context: Context? // save context to continue conversation
    let roomDescription = RoomDescription()

    public init() {

         conversation.message(withWorkspace: workspaceID, failure: failure) { response in
                print(response.output.text)
                self.context = response.context
            }

    }
    …
----



[start=9]
. In the handleMessage method in RoomImplementation.swift, there is a switch block on the message target.  In the case of target == “room”, the message is either a command or a chat. We want to send the chat messages to the Conversation service and then send Watson’s response back to the client. 
+
Add the Watson code in the “else” block:
+
[source,swift]
----
         if messageIsCommand(content: content) {
                try processCommand(message: message, content: content, endpoint: endpoint, connection: connection)
         }
         else {

                let request = MessageRequest(text: content, context: context)
                conversation.message(withWorkspace: workspaceID, request: request, failure: failure) {
                    response in
                    print(response.output.text)

                    if response.output.text.count > 0 {

                        let text = response.output.text[0]
                        try! endpoint.sendMessage(connection: connection,
                                         message: Message.createChatMessage(username: "Watson", message: text ))

                    }
                    
                    self.context = response.context
                }

                try endpoint.sendMessage(connection: connection,
                                         message: Message.createChatMessage(username: username, message: content))
            }

----
+
That should be it!

[start=10]
. Compile your project with
+
[source]
----
$ npm install
$ gulp
----

[start=11]
. Run your server
[source]
----
$ .build/debug/GameOn
----

Then access http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. Visiting this page provides a small chat window you can use to test Watson in your service directly.


## Suggested extensions

The more the Conversation service is developed, the more interesting this adventure will be. Use your imagination!

## Conclusion

We hope you enjoyed this adventure and feel inspired to explore your GameOn Swift room with Watson.
