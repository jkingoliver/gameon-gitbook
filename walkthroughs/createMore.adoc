Beyond the cave of grues, fantastic adventures await.

What else do you want to try? We have several walkthroughs, both long and short,
to help you explore aspects of cloud native or microservice applications. We'll
be adding more here over time, and accept suggestions / comments via our
{slack}[slack] =).

toc::[]

=== Caching

Want to store something for a while? have the same view of state across multiple
instances of a service? Caching may be just what you need.

* [languagename]#JAVA#{jsr107b}[Caching with JSR107 API and Redis]

=== REST

Need to talk to another service using REST? We've got you covered.

* [languagename]#JAVA#{jaxrs}[Using REST via JAX-RS to talk to the Map Service]

=== Persistence

Having trouble remembering things? wish there was a a way to store them somewhere?

* [languagename]#JAVA#{cloudant}[Persistence via Cloudant]

=== Room Improvements

The basic room only goes so far, the protocol allows for much more. Want to
add custom items, or commands to you room ? Want to know how to do it properly?
Curious about the details of the protocol required to create a room in a new
language / framework?

* [languagename]#JAVA#{addingItems}[Adding items to your room]

=== Game On Development

Maybe you want to play with the core Game On services, maybe you are just looking
for more information on how to develop your room. Here are a few guides to help
you on your way.

* [languagename]#GENERIC#{local-docker}[Local development using Docker]

=== Scale

Let's say you want to make the most popular room ever (an admirable
goal), which means your room will need to scale to more than one
instance. How do you propagate chat and events across scaled room
instances to make sure that it feels like one big room?

You might also explore creating several rooms that relate to each other.
Should each service be an individual room, or would quantum entanglement
between the rooms make the bounded context be the suite, rather than any
individual room? Would rooms need share state or communicate? Given that
services should remain fiercely independent, where does that state go?

=== Fault tolerance

Let's say your service calls another service. This could be a cloud data source
or a Watson API. In cloud native environments, that backing store might disappear
at any time. Or the network might be flaky. Or the API could be rate limited.

What then?

Fault tolerance is an essential part of writing a microservices application,
and most languages have existing libraries to help you write fault tolerant code.
You should focus on two questions: how long should you wait for something to fail?
and what should you do when it fails?

Circuit breakers are a follow-on action to improve fault tolerance by avoiding
interacting with known-bad services. In some cases, underlying infrastructure
will manage circuit breaking behavior, though in general, your application or
service should have some notion of what to do if calls to the service repeatedly
fail.
